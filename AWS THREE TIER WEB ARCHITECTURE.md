**PROJECT: AWS THREE TIER WEB ARCHITECTURE**

**Architecture:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b24ecea7-a646-43e4-96d4-2e80b9972e4a)

In this architecture:

1.  **Public-Facing Load Balancer**:
    -   An **Application Load Balancer** (ALB) handles client traffic and forwards it to the web tier EC2 instances.
2.  **Web Tier**:
    -   EC2 instances running **Nginx** webservers serve a **React.js** website.
    -   Nginx redirects API calls to the internal facing load balancer.
3.  **Internal Facing Load Balancer**:
    -   This load balancer forwards traffic to the application tier.
4.  **Application Tier**:
    -   Written in **Node.js**, this tier processes data and interacts with the database.
5.  **Database**:
    -   **Aurora MySQL** with multi-AZ deployment for high availability and durability.
6.  **Load Balancing & Autoscaling**:
    -   Load balancing, health checks, and autoscaling groups are implemented at each layer to ensure the architecture's availability and performance.

**S3 Bucket Creation**

1.  Created a new S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
2.  This bucket is where we will upload our code later.

**IAM EC2 Instance Role Creation**

1.  Created an EC2 role in the IAM dashboard.
2.  Set EC2 as the trusted entity.
3.  Added the policies **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** and **AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.**
4.  Named the role as **3tier** and created it."

1.  **Networking and Security**
-   Create an isolated network with the following components:
    -   VPC
    -   Subnets
    -   Route Tables
    -   Internet Gateway
    -   NAT gateway
    -   Security Groups

**VPC** (**CIDR range** : 10.0.0.0/16)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/021313d7-4383-4b93-a53e-d2cd528c345c)



**Subnet**

**Six** subnets across **two** availability zones. That means that **three** subnets will be in one availability zone, and three subnets will be in another zone.

| **us-east-2b**                       | **us-east-2c**                       |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Public-Subnet-AZ-1 (10.0.0.0/24)     | Public-Subnet-AZ-2 (10.0.3.0/24)     |
| Private-Subnet-AZ-1 (10.0.1.0/24)    | Private-Subnet-AZ-2 (10.0.4.0/24)    |
| Private-DB-Subnet-AZ-1 (10.0.2.0/24) | Private-DB-Subnet-AZ-2 (10.0.5.0/24) |

**Web Instance Deployment**:

1.  Create a new instance similar to the App Tier instance, but this time select a public subnet. Ensure you choose the correct network components, security group, and IAM role.
2.  Auto-assign a public IP on the **Configure Instance Details** page.
3.  Tag the instance with a name for easier identification.

**Web Instance Testing**:

1.  Access your website using the public IP of your web tier instance, found on the EC2 instance details page.
2.  Verify that the website is displaying correctly and that the database is functioning. You should be able to add data.
3.  Be cautious with the delete button as it will clear all entries in your database.
